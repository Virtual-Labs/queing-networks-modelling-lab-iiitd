* Objective
  - To Simulate the “Retrial Markovian Models for Bulk Arrival/Service” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/queueing-networks-modelling-lab-iitd/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Retrial Markovian Models for Bulk Arrival Service/Retrial Markovian Models for Bulk Arrival Service_01_Usability_smk.org][Retrial Markovian Models for Bulk Arrival Service_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the “Live Simulation” link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Enter the values in arrival rate,departure fields,number of servers,system capacity and choose the type of queuing and click on the appropriate radio button
  4. Click on start button
  5. While the simulation is running , click on the pause button
  6. click on the play button and now click on the reset button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. The simulation result should be displayed on the screen
  4. The simulation graph should be paused and when we click on the play button the graph should start 
  5. When we click on the reset button , the simulation result, graph and the entered values should be erased from the screen
