* Objective
  - To Simulate the “Retrial Markovian Models for Bulk Arrival/Service” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/queueing-networks-modelling-lab-iitd/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Retrial Markovian Models for Bulk Arrival Service/Retrial Markovian Models for Bulk Arrival Service_01_Usability_smk.org][Retrial Markovian Models for Bulk Arrival Service_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the “Live Simulation” link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Enter the invalid values in arrival rate,departure fields,number of servers and system capacity
  4. Click on start button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. An error message should be displayed on the screen as to enter the valid values in the corresponding fields

* Review/comments
