* Objective
  - To Simulate the “Non Markovian Models for Bulk Arrival/Service” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/queueing-networks-modelling-lab-iitd/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Non Markovian Models for Bulk Arrival Service/Non Markovian Models for Bulk Arrival Service_01_Usability_smk.org][Non Markovian Models for Bulk Arrival Service_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the “Live Simulation of M/G/1 , G/M/1 , G/G/1 - Single Server” link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Select 'M' and  enter the parameter values and capacity of the system value
  4. Click on start button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. The simulation result should be displayed on the screen

* Review/comments
