* Test Steps
  1. Click on the “Live Simulation of Three Node Open Tandem Queue” link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Enter the input and output parameter values and  check on all paths
  4. Now uncheck the system and click on start button
  5. While the simulation is running , click on the pause button
  6. click on the play button and now click on the reset button
