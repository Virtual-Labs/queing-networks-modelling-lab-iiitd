* Objective
  - To Simulate the “Discrete time Experiments” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/queueing-networks-modelling-lab-iitd/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Discrete time Experiments/Discrete time Experiments_01_Usability_smk.org][Discrete time Experiments_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the “Live Simulation of Discrete time bulk arrival and bulk departure model” link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Enter the values in arrival rate,departure fields,number of servers,system capacity and choose the type of queuing and click on the appropriate radio button
  4. Check on the Bulk departure and choose the batch type either full or partial
  5. Don't enter the departure size value and click on start button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. An error message should be displayed on the screen as to enter the departure size value

* Review/comments
