* Objective
  - To Simulate the “Discrete time Experiments” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/queueing-networks-modelling-lab-iitd/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Discrete time Experiments/Discrete time Experiments_01_Usability_smk.org][Discrete time Experiments_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the “Live Simulation of Discrete time bulk arrival and bulk departure model” link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Don't enter the values in arrival rate,departure fields,number of servers and system capacity
  4. Click on start button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. An error message should be displayed on the screen as to enter the values in the corresponding fields

* Review/comments
