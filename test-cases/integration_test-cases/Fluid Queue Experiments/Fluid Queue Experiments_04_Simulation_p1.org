* Objective
  - To Simulate the “Fluid Queue Experiments” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/queueing-networks-modelling-lab-iitd/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Fluid Queue Experiments/Fluid Queue Experiments_01_Usability_smk.org][Fluid Queue Experiments_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the “Live Simulation of Fluid Queue with infinite buffer” link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Enter the invalid  values in inflow rates,outflow rates,arrival rate, departure rate and number of states
  4. Click on start button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. An error message should be displayed on the screen as to enter the valid inflow rates,outflow rates,arrival rate, departure rate and number of states values

* Review/comments
