* Objective
  - To Simulate the “Fluid Queue Experiments” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/queueing-networks-modelling-lab-iitd/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Fluid Queue Experiments/Fluid Queue Experiments_01_Usability_smk.org][Fluid Queue Experiments_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the “Live Simulation of Fluid Queue with finite buffer” link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Enter the inflow rates,outflow rates,arrival rate, departure rate,buffer capacity and number of states values 
  4. Click on reset button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. The entered values in the fields should be erased

* Review/comments
