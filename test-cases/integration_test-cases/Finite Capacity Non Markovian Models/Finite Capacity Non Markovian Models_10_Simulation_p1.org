* Objective
  - To Simulate the “Finite Capacity Non Markovian Models” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/queueing-networks-modelling-lab-iitd/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Finite Capacity Non Markovian Models/Finite Capacity Non Markovian Models_01_Usability_smk.org][Finite Capacity Non Markovian Models_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the “Live Simulation of M/G/1 , G/M/1 , G/G/1 - Single Server” link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Select 'G' and choose the type of distribution from the drop down list displayed on the screen and enter the values only in one field and click on start button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. An error message should be displayed on the screen as to enter the valid values in all the fields

* Review/comments
